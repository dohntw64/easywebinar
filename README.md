# EasyWebinar Review: All-in-One Webinar Platform with AI Builder, Built-in CRM, 50% Off Deal

You know that feeling when you're scrolling through yet another software comparison page, and every tool promises to be "the best," but you're still sitting there thinking: "Okay, but which one actually works for normal people like me?"

Well, let me tell you about EasyWebinar. I won't pretend it's perfect for everyone, because nothing is. But after digging through what this platform actually does—not just what their sales page claims—I found something pretty interesting happening here.

<img width="3272" height="1824" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d931656-1197-4055-b403-19c1df18651c" />

**Why Webinars Still Matter in 2026**

Here's the thing about webinars: they're not going anywhere. While everyone's chasing the next shiny marketing tactic, webinars quietly keep converting leads into customers. Think about it—you're getting someone to voluntarily sit and listen to you for 30 to 60 minutes. That's basically a first date in business terms.

EasyWebinar is a webinar hosting platform that lets you run both live and automated webinars from one dashboard. The company's been around since the webinar boom days, and they've recently rolled out some updates that actually matter—like an AI webinar builder and a built-in sales CRM that comes free with annual plans.

What caught my attention wasn't just the features list. It was how they're positioning themselves: not as "just another webinar tool," but as a complete revenue system. Bold claim. Let's see if it holds up.

**What EasyWebinar Actually Does**

At its core, EasyWebinar handles three main webinar types: live webinars (you show up in real-time), automated webinars (pre-recorded but scheduled to feel live), and evergreen webinars (available on-demand, running 24/7). Most platforms make you choose one path. EasyWebinar says, "Why not all three?"

The platform recently introduced an AI Webinar Builder. Now, before you roll your eyes at another "AI-powered" feature, hear me out. This thing actually generates your entire webinar funnel—landing pages, email sequences, engagement elements—based on your business goals. Does it replace human creativity? No. Does it speed up the tedious setup work? Absolutely.

The registration process is refreshingly simple. People can sign up with one click, no lengthy forms asking for their life story. The platform auto-integrates with major email tools like Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, and GetResponse. Your webinar leads flow directly into your existing email lists without manual exports or CSV file gymnastics.

Once people register, they land in what EasyWebinar calls "smart engagement tracking." The system monitors who showed up, who stayed until the end, who clicked your offers, and who bounced after five minutes. This isn't vanity metrics—it's actual behavioral data you can use.

For those considering a complete webinar solution that handles both live and automated formats seamlessly, 👉 [explore EasyWebinar's current pricing and features here](https://easywebinar.com?fp_ref=o0l0p5). Right now, they're running a significant promotion that makes their Professional plan considerably more affordable than it usually runs.

**Live Webinars: When You Need to Show Up**

Live webinars in EasyWebinar support up to 200 attendees on the Professional plan (more on Enterprise). You get HD video streaming with zero delay, which matters more than you'd think. Ever been on a webinar where the presenter's mouth moves three seconds before you hear them? Yeah, that doesn't happen here.

The "green room" feature is smart. Before you go live, you and your co-hosts gather in a private space to check audio, video, and nerves. Then you click "Start Broadcast" when you're ready. No fumbling around in front of your audience.

During live sessions, you've got real-time chat, polls, Q&A, and what they call "dynamic presentation control." That means you can switch between screen sharing, your webcam, and pre-loaded slides without technical meltdowns. Multiple presenters can hand off control smoothly.

One underrated feature: you can stream your EasyWebinar session directly to YouTube Live and Facebook Live simultaneously. That's free additional reach without hosting two separate events.

Live sessions can run up to two hours on the basic Launch plan, four hours on Professional and Automated plans. If you need longer, Enterprise gives you extended options.

**Automated Webinars: The Always-On Sales Machine**

This is where things get interesting. Automated webinars are pre-recorded videos that play at scheduled times, creating the feel of a live event without you actually being there. Some people find this ethically murky. Others see it as smart scaling.

EasyWebinar's automated webinars include "simulive" mode—simulated live. The webinar streams in real-time (not just a video player), shows countdown timers, displays pre-written chat messages that appear organically, and creates urgency with timed offers that expire when the session ends.

Is anyone fooled? Probably not entirely. But does it work better than a plain "watch this video" page? According to multiple case studies and user reviews, yes. The structure and urgency matter.

You can set automated webinars to run daily, weekly, or multiple times per day across different time zones. The system automatically adjusts for each attendee's local time, so someone in Tokyo and someone in New York both see "starting in 15 minutes" even though they're registering hours apart.

Evergreen webinars take this further—they start the moment someone registers, typically after a short countdown (like "starting in 10 minutes"). This is the true "passive income" setup people chase. Upload your webinar once, configure the funnel, then let it run indefinitely.

For businesses looking to automate their sales process without sacrificing engagement quality, 👉 [check out EasyWebinar's automated webinar capabilities](https://easywebinar.com?fp_ref=o0l0p5). The Automated plan starts at $120/month (currently discounted) and includes everything you need for evergreen funnels.

**The Built-in CRM: Wait, They Include a CRM Now?**

Here's where EasyWebinar made a move I didn't expect. They built a full sales CRM directly into the platform, and it comes free with annual subscriptions on Professional, Automated, and Enterprise plans.

The CRM auto-captures every lead from your webinars. No exporting lists, no manual entry. Someone registers? They're in the CRM. They attend? The CRM tracks it. They click your offer? Logged. They drop off halfway through? The CRM knows.

What makes this useful is the engagement-based lead scoring. The system automatically segments leads into "Hot" (high engagement, clicked offers), "Warm" (attended but didn't buy), and "Nurture" (registered but didn't show up). Your sales team immediately knows who to call first.

The built-in auto dialer lets you call leads directly from the CRM. Automated email and call follow-ups trigger based on behavior. Sales pipeline tracking shows where each lead sits in your funnel. Customer activity timelines display every interaction in one place.

Is this CRM going to replace Salesforce for enterprise companies? Of course not. But for solo entrepreneurs, coaches, and small businesses running webinar funnels, having lead capture, scoring, and follow-up in the same tool as your webinars? That's legitimately convenient.

**Pricing Breakdown: What You Actually Pay**

Let's talk money. EasyWebinar offers four main plans, and they're currently running a promotion (typical for SaaS companies, but worth noting):

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (Monthly Equivalent) | What You Get | Best For |
|------|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Launch** (Live Only) | $44/month | $36/month (billed $432/year) | Up to 4 live webinars, 100 attendees, 2-hour sessions, 1 co-host, basic CRM integrations | Testing webinars, occasional live events |
| **Professional** (Live + Automated) | $116/month | $96/month (billed $1,152/year) | Up to 5 active webinars, 200 live/1,000 automated attendees, 4-hour sessions, 3 co-hosts, AI Builder, built-in CRM (free with annual), YouTube streaming | Most businesses, coaches, course creators |
| **Automated** (Automated Only) | $144/month | $120/month (billed $1,440/year) | Up to 5 active automated webinars, 2,500 attendees, AI Builder, built-in CRM (free with annual), evergreen funnels | Pure automation, 24/7 sales funnels |
| **Enterprise** | Custom Quote | Custom Quote | Unlimited sessions, API access, white-label, custom domains, dedicated manager, VIP support | Large teams, high-volume needs |

Annual plans save you roughly 18% compared to monthly billing, plus you get the built-in CRM at no extra charge (which they value separately).

Storage: Launch gets 2GB, Professional and Automated get 4GB, Enterprise gets unlimited. That translates to roughly 10-20 hours of HD webinar recordings on the middle-tier plans, which is plenty for most users.

Third-party sites report additional discounts and promo codes floating around. I found references to 30% off coupons on various coupon sites, though you'll want to verify those directly since promo codes change frequently. The platform occasionally runs seasonal promotions (like the "Holiday Sale" mentioned on their homepage) that can stack with referral discounts.

If you're committed to using webinars as a core marketing strategy, the annual Professional plan at $96/month is the sweet spot. You get both live and automated capabilities, the AI builder, the CRM, and enough attendee capacity for most growing businesses. 👉 [See current pricing and available discounts here](https://easywebinar.com?fp_ref=o0l0p5).

**The AI Webinar Builder: Hype or Helper?**

Let's address the elephant in the room: AI features. Everyone's slapping "AI-powered" on their products these days, often with minimal substance. So what does EasyWebinar's AI Builder actually do?

According to their documentation and user reports, the AI Webinar Builder walks you through a series of questions about your business, target audience, and goals. Based on your answers, it generates:

- A complete landing page with headline, copy, and registration form
- Email sequences for reminders and follow-ups
- Suggested poll questions and engagement elements
- Offer presentation structure
- Automated post-webinar sequences

Does this output sound like a seasoned copywriter wrote it? No. Will you need to edit and personalize it? Absolutely. But does it eliminate the paralysis of staring at a blank page? Yes.

The bigger benefit is speed. Setting up a webinar funnel from scratch—registration page, thank you page, reminder emails, the webinar itself, follow-up sequences—can easily take 8-10 hours for someone new to webinars. The AI Builder reportedly gets you to a rough draft in 30-45 minutes.

You still need to customize everything, upload your actual webinar video, adjust the branding, and fine-tune the copy. But the structure is there. For people who overthink strategy and delay launching, this kind of scaffolding can be the difference between "I'll do it someday" and "It's live this week."

**Integration Ecosystem: Playing Nice with Your Stack**

EasyWebinar connects natively with all the email platforms you'd expect: Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, AWeber, Keap, GetResponse, HubSpot, ConvertKit, Drip, Ontraport, and HighLevel. Registration data flows automatically into these systems, tagged appropriately so you can segment and automate.

For payment processing, EasyWebinar integrates with Stripe and PayPal if you're running paid webinars or selling directly during automated events. You can set up order forms that appear as timed offers during your presentation.

Zapier connectivity opens up hundreds more integrations if you need something specific. Want registrations to create Trello cards, update Google Sheets, or trigger custom Slack notifications? All possible through Zapier.

The platform also offers webhook support and API access (on Enterprise plans) for custom integrations if you have developers on your team.

**User Reviews: The Good, the Bad, the Reality**

I dug through reviews on Trustpilot, G2, Capterra, and Reddit to get past the marketing claims. Here's what actual users are saying:

**Positive feedback consistently mentioned:**

- Excellent customer support, particularly from team members named Manasa, Rakesh, and Naman (multiple reviews specifically called them out)
- User-friendly interface that doesn't require technical expertise
- Reliable streaming quality with minimal lag or technical issues
- Powerful analytics that actually help improve conversion rates
- The automated webinar features work as advertised and generate sales on autopilot

One user wrote: "We've been using EasyWebinar for a long time, and we've been very happy with the platform. The app is user-friendly and reliable, making it easy for us to host webinars and automate our processes."

Another mentioned: "The entire customer support team was great. I wanted to do a webinar but I don't love tech stuff and didn't want to spend months figuring everything out. Easy Webinar made the process much easier than it could have been!"

**Common complaints included:**

- The recent platform update (called "EasyWebinar Next") introduced bugs that frustrated long-time users
- One user reported issues with language localization—webinar rooms defaulting to English regardless of settings
- Black bars appearing beside video streams (though support indicated this is common across platforms)
- Refund policy frustrations from users who canceled but were still charged

One frustrated review stated: "I used Easywebinar for years, but since Easywebinar next, there are so many bugs, that I changed the platform. It was not possible for me to create a stable working automated webinar."

The overall Trustpilot rating sits at 3.9 out of 5 stars (31 reviews), which is respectable but not exceptional. G2 and Capterra ratings are slightly higher, around 4 out of 5.

What's worth noting: the negative reviews mostly came from users experiencing the transition to the updated platform. Growing pains with major updates are common in SaaS. The question is whether the company resolves them quickly. Recent reviews (late 2024 into 2025) show fewer bug complaints, suggesting stabilization.

**Who Should Actually Use EasyWebinar**

This platform makes sense for specific types of users:

**Great fit:**
- Online coaches and consultants selling high-ticket services
- Course creators who want to automate launches
- B2B companies running regular product demos
- Real estate agents hosting property showcases
- Authors and speakers doing book launches or workshops
- Anyone who wants both live and automated options in one tool

**Not ideal for:**
- Simple one-off webinars (might be overkill if you only need a basic webinar once)
- Companies needing 1,000+ live attendees regularly (Zoom or GoToWebinar handle larger crowds better)
- Businesses requiring extensive white-labeling on lower-tier plans (Enterprise only)
- People uncomfortable with automated "simulive" webinars on ethical grounds

The platform's strength is versatility. You're not locked into either live-only or automated-only. You can test live webinars to see what converts, then automate your best-performing presentations to run evergreen.

For entrepreneurs and small teams who want a complete webinar funnel solution without juggling five different tools, 👉 [EasyWebinar offers a compelling all-in-one approach](https://easywebinar.com?fp_ref=o0l0p5). The combination of hosting, landing pages, email automation, and built-in CRM saves both money and mental overhead.

**Alternatives to Consider**

Fair is fair—EasyWebinar isn't the only option. Here's how it stacks up against competitors:

**WebinarJam/EverWebinar:** These are separate products from the same company (owned by Genesis Digital). WebinarJam handles live webinars, EverWebinar does automated. You need both for full functionality, which gets expensive. EasyWebinar combines these in one platform.

**Demio:** Beautiful interface, strong live webinar features, but limited automated webinar capabilities. Better for teams focused primarily on live events.

**Zoom Webinars:** Handles massive audiences (10,000+) and integrates with Zoom Meetings most companies already use. But zero native automation features, minimal marketing tools, and no built-in CRM.

**Livestorm:** European-based platform with excellent GDPR compliance and clean UI. Strong on live webinars, weaker on evergreen automation compared to EasyWebinar.

**eWebinar:** Focused exclusively on automated webinars with real-time chat. No live webinar functionality at all. Good if you know you'll never go live.

EasyWebinar sits in the middle: not the absolute best at any single thing, but competent at everything webinar-related. For most businesses, "pretty good at everything" beats "excellent at one thing and terrible at another."

**The Evergreen Webinar Strategy: Does It Work?**

Let's address the elephant in the room: automated evergreen webinars. Some marketers swear by them. Others call them manipulative.

Here's the reality: evergreen webinars work when done ethically. The key is transparency. If you're pretending something is live when it's not, that's dishonest. But if you're upfront that it's a recorded presentation available on-demand, while still creating structure and urgency? That's just good marketing.

EasyWebinar lets you choose your approach. You can be fully transparent ("Watch our pre-recorded training now") or use simulive elements that blur the line. My take: err on the side of transparency. People aren't stupid, and they appreciate honesty more than fake urgency.

What makes evergreen webinars valuable is the 24/7 sales potential. A well-crafted automated webinar can generate leads and sales while you sleep. I've seen case studies of six-figure launches from single evergreen webinars running for months.

The formula typically involves:
1. A registration page with clear value proposition
2. A 45-60 minute presentation teaching something valuable
3. A pitch for your product/service in the last 15 minutes
4. A time-limited offer that expires after the webinar
5. Follow-up email sequences for both buyers and non-buyers

EasyWebinar handles all five steps in one platform. Whether you use them ethically or sleazily is up to you.

**Technical Performance and Reliability**

Based on user reviews and independent testing, EasyWebinar's streaming infrastructure is solid. HD video quality, minimal buffering, and low latency are consistently reported. The platform uses enterprise-grade servers to handle concurrent webinars without degradation.

Uptime appears reliable, with no major outage reports in recent reviews. That said, any webinar platform can experience technical hiccups. Always have a backup plan—record your live webinars so you can switch to automated replay if streaming fails.

The mobile experience is functional but not exceptional. Attendees can join from smartphones or tablets, but the interface is clearly optimized for desktop. If you expect significant mobile attendance, test the experience thoroughly before your first major event.

Analytics load quickly, exports work smoothly, and the dashboard navigation is intuitive once you learn where things are. New users report a slight learning curve, but nothing that a couple hours of exploration won't solve.

**Final Verdict: Is EasyWebinar Worth It?**

Here's my honest take after digging through this platform: EasyWebinar is solid. Not revolutionary, not perfect, but solidly good at what it does.

If you're serious about webinars as a marketing channel—not just testing the waters with a single event—EasyWebinar gives you everything you need in one place. The combination of live, automated, and evergreen capabilities means you can evolve your strategy without switching platforms.

The built-in CRM is a genuine bonus for small businesses who don't want to pay for separate lead management software. It's basic compared to enterprise CRMs, but basic is often enough.

The AI Webinar Builder won't write your content for you, but it speeds up the setup process significantly. Think of it as a smart template generator, not a replacement for strategy.

At $96/month (annual Professional plan), you're paying less than the combined cost of a webinar platform ($50-70), landing page builder ($30-50), email automation ($20-30), and CRM ($30-50) separately. The math works in EasyWebinar's favor if you use at least three of these features.

The platform isn't perfect. The recent update caused growing pains that frustrated some long-time users. Customer support is excellent when you need it, but you shouldn't need it constantly. Hopefully the bugs continue to stabilize.

Would I recommend EasyWebinar? For the right user—yes. If you're an entrepreneur, coach, or small business owner who wants to build webinar funnels without becoming a tech expert, this platform removes most obstacles between you and going live.

If you're still on the fence, EasyWebinar offers a demo and trial options to test before committing. Take advantage of that. Run a test webinar with a small audience. See if the interface clicks with your brain. Check whether the automated features match your ethical standards.

For those ready to integrate webinars into their marketing strategy with a platform that handles both live and automated formats while including essential CRM capabilities, 👉 [explore EasyWebinar's current offers and start your trial](https://easywebinar.com?fp_ref=o0l0p5). The discount running through January 2026 makes it particularly attractive timing.
